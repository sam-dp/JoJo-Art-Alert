# JoJos Art Scraper and Viewer

Jojos Art Scraper and Viewer is a Web Scraper and Image Viewer that stores and displays the archived artworks of artist and mangaka Hirohiko Araki, most known for his animanga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. The user can choose between using a previously-populated database or running the scraper to get the most up-to-date gallery. 

I was inspired to create this project because I have long enjoyed Araki's artwork for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and wanted to challenge myself to create something that interacts with the web, handles lots of data, and uses a GUI.
